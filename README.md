This tool helps you solve ctf tasks by automating workflow and basic analysis and providing useful utilities.

## Installation

You can get the latest binary from https://github.com/rerrorctf/ret/releases.

Here installation just means putting `ret` somewhere on your path. I like to make a symlink it to in `/usr/local/bin`.

```
$ sudo ln -s ./ret /usr/local/bin/ret
```

Other options are available and you may do whatever works best for you.

### Compiling (Optional)

First install `go` https://go.dev/dl/ by following the install instructions.

You can use `go` in system repos but they tend to be fairly old and out of date.

Now, the project root directory, you can simply do:

```
$ go build
```

This will produce the `ret` binary. This single file is all you need to use `ret`.

There is also a `build.sh` that I use to create the binaries that get uploaded to github.

```
$ ./build.sh
```

## Commands

You can list all the commands by using `-h`, `--help`, `help` or simply providing no arguments:

```
$ ret help
```

You can get help for a command by giving `help` as an argument to the command:

```
$ ret command help
```

### abi ü§ù

```
ret abi [architecture] [os]
```

Prints reference details about the abi for the given platform.

### libc üóΩ

```
ret libc [tag]
```

Creates and runs a Docker container based on the given tag.

By default will use ubuntu:latest as the tag if none is provided.

A Dockerfile and a script will be created and then run in a temp directory.

The script will build, run, stop and remove the container.

When the container is running `libc.so.6` will be copied from the container.

After the container is destroyed the file is added with ret.

https://github.com/rerrorctf/ret/blob/main/commands/libc.go

### proxy üì°

```
ret proxy [list/create]
```

This command manages SSH proxies.

1. **Listing Proxies**:
   - Command: `ret proxy list`
   - Description: Lists all currently active SSH proxies that are using local port forwarding (`ssh -L`). It parses the output of `ps aux` to find relevant SSH processes and displays their details, including the local port, remote IP, remote port, and process ID.

2. **Creating Proxies**:
   - Command: `ret proxy create local-port remote-ip remote-port [ssh-ip]`
   - Description: Creates a new SSH proxy with local port forwarding. It requires the local port, remote IP, and remote port as arguments. Optionally, an SSH IP can be specified. The command uses the current user's credentials to establish the SSH connection.

https://github.com/rerrorctf/ret/blob/main/commands/proxy.go

### pwn üêö

```
ret pwn [ip] [port]
```

Creates a pwntools script from a template.

If `~/.config/ret` contains a value for `pwnscripttemplate` the contents of this file will be used as the template instead.

If a custom template is in use `pwn` will take the contents of the file at this path and do the following substitutions:
  - :%s/\%BINARY\%/task
    - where task is the result of util.GuessBinary()
  - :%s/\%IP\%/127.0.0.1
    - where 127.0.0.1 is the supplied ip address
  - :%s/\%PORT\%/9001
    - where 9001 is the supplied port

For example:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from pwn import *

#context.log_level = "debug"
elf = ELF("./%BINARY%", checksec=False)
context.binary = elf

#p = elf.process()
#p = elf.debug(gdbscript="")
p = remote("%IP%", %PORT%)

p.interactive()
```

Might be transformed into:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from pwn import *

#context.log_level = "debug"
elf = ELF("./task", checksec=False)
context.binary = elf

#p = elf.process()
#p = elf.debug(gdbscript="")
p = remote("127.0.0.1", 9001)

p.interactive()
```

Note the placement of the `"` characters.

https://github.com/rerrorctf/ret/blob/main/commands/pwn.go

### sage üåø

```
ret sage
```

Just runs:

```bash
$ sudo docker pull sagemath/sagemath
$ sudo docker run -it sagemath/sagemath:latest
```

See https://hub.docker.com/r/sagemath/sagemath for more information.

https://github.com/rerrorctf/ret/blob/main/commands/sage.go

### status üëÄ

### syscall üìû

```
ret syscall [(x86/32)/(x64/64)] [regex-pattern]
```

Greps syscall headers for x86 and x64 linux.

For x86 linux we use:
`/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/asm/unistd_32.h`

For x64 linux we use:
`/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/asm/unistd_64.h`

For example:

`syscall x64 " 0"`

`syscall x64 write`

`syscall 32 read`

`syscall x86 10[0-9]`

### wizard üßô

```
ret wizard [ip] [port]
```

Wizard is here to help! They simply run a few common commands for a typical workflow. The workflow is quite well suited for typical rev and pwn tasks. Sometimes the wizard makes mistakes!

1) Executes the `wizardprecommand` from ~/.config/ret.
2) Searches for interesting files within the current directory.
3) Ensures that the hidden .ret directory skeleton exists.
4) Unzips any .zip files that it can.
5) Adds any interesting files. This includes those found by unzipping and ignores .zip files.
6) Shows `status`.
7) If the wizard thinks there is an elf file it will invoke `pwn` for you.
8) If you provided an ip or an ip and a port wizard will pass these to `pwn` for you.
9) Executes the `wizardpostcommand` from ~/.config/ret.

https://github.com/rerrorctf/ret/blob/main/commands/wizard.go

### writeup üìù

```
ret writeup
```

Create a writeup template for a task in a file called `writeup.md`.

## ~/.config/ret

`ret` will parse `~/.config/ret`.

While I aim to keep this readme in sync; for the current structure of the config file please consult https://github.com/rerrorctf/ret/blob/main/data/config.go#L3.

The data in the config must be in the json format. You can include zero or more of the following in your config:

- `ghidrainstallpath`
  - This is the location where you have installed ghidra, e.g. `/opt/ghidra` is what I use, so that `ret ghidra` knows where to find `ghidraRun`.
  - The current default value is `/opt/ghidra` as per https://github.com/rerrorctf/ret/blob/main/config/config.go#L12

- `ghidraprojectpath`
  - This is what you would like the ghidra folder, created by `ret`, to be called within the `.ret` folder to be called e.g. `./.ret/ghidra`.
  - The current default value is `./.ret/ghidra` as per https://github.com/rerrorctf/ret/blob/main/config/config.go#L13

- `idainstallpath`
  - This is the location where you have installed ghidra, e.g. `/opt/ida`, so that `ret ida` knows where to find ida.
  - The current default value is `/opt/ida` as per https://github.com/rerrorctf/ret/blob/main/config/config.go#L14

- `idaprojectpath`
  - This is what you would like the ida folder, created by `ret`, to be called within the `.ret` folder to be called e.g. `./.ret/ida`.
  - The current default value is `./.ret/ida` as per https://github.com/rerrorctf/ret/blob/main/config/config.go#L15

- `pwnscriptname`
  - This is what you would like the script created by `ret pwn` to be called.
  - The default is `go.py` and is chosen to be short and not clash with any common imports as per https://github.com/rerrorctf/ret/blob/main/config/config.go#L25

- `pwnscripttemplate`
  - Path to a template to that can be used to override the default behaviour of pwn.

- `flagformat`
  - This is the regular expression that matches the flag format for the ctf you are currently playing.
  - The default is `flag{.+}`.

- `wizardprecommand`
  - This will be executed by the `wizard` before they do any of their own magic.
  - It is passed to `bash -c`

- `wizardpostcommand`
  - This will be executed by the `wizard` after they have worked their own magic.
  - It is passed to `bash -c`

- `chatusername`
  - This username will be used when sending messages with the chat command.
  - Note there is no username authentication present.

- `chatwebhookurl`
  - An optional discord webhook url.
  - This will be used by the `chat` command to send messages to discord.

- `gisttoken`
  - An optional github gist token with read/write gist permissions is required to use the gist command.
  - https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta
  - https://docs.github.com/en/rest/gists/gists?apiVersion=2022-11-28#create-a-gist

- `openaikey`
  - An optional OpenAI key used with the `gpt` command

- `googlecloudproject`
  - The optional name of the GCP project you wish to create virtual machines within when using the vps command.

- `googlecloudregion`
  - The optional GCP region to create virtual machines within when using the vps command.
  - Default is `europe-west3-c`.

- `googlecloudsshkey`
  - The optional ssh key to supply as metadata when creating GCP virtual machines when using the vps command.
  - Should be of the following form:
    - `"user:pubkey"`
      - Where `user` is the username you wish to use to login to the server.

## The .ret Directory Structure

Certain commands, such as `add` and `status` will use a hidden directory structure.

This is technically configurable via https://github.com/rerrorctf/ret/blob/main/config/config.go#L5 but this is not exposed to the user config. In other words you can change this be changing the source code and building your own version if you wish. If there is a strong desire to change this I would consider adding it to the user config.

You can delete this directory if you like or make changes as you see fit but just be aware that the tool makes certain assumptions about the contents.

This directory is structured as follows:

- `.ret/files`
  - This directory contains files and metadata about files added to the task by the `add` command
  - For each file added a subdirectory of files is created that is named using the SHA2-256 hex digest of the file content
    - e.g. `.ret/files/7ebfc53f17925af4340d4218aafd16ba39b5afa8b6ac1f7adc3dd92952a2a237`
    - Inside of the folder created for each file
      - There is a copy of the file that was added

- `.ret/ghidra`
  - This directory is created to store the ghidra project created if you use the `ghidra` command
  - Note that you can change this with `~/.config/ret` as above

- `.ret/ida`
  - This directory is created to store the ida project created if you use the `ida` command
  - Note that you can change this with `~/.config/ret` as above

- `.ret/flag.json`
  - This file contains the flag saved with the `ctf` command
